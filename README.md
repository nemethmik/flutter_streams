# flutter_streams/json_streamer

This is a remake and abridged version of the original work of [Tensor Flutter Streams](https://github.com/tensor-programming/flutter_streams) which had an explanation video [Building Dynamic Lists with Streams in Dart's Flutter Framework](https://youtu.be/hvvYA1N-tEc) 

The original example didn't use stream builder, interestingly.

I have added gitignore, but it compiled and worked great right after forking.
